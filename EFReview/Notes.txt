To get going with Code First Workflow of EF:

1. Add Entity Framework via Package Manager Console 'install-package EntityFramework'
2. Add model class for database table (eg. Post.cs)
3. Add DB Context class for database abstraction (eg. BlogDbContext.cs)
	this class should derive from DbContext from System.Data.Entity namespace
4. In DB Context class add DbSet<T> property for model class (eg. public DbSet<Post> Posts {get; set;})
5. Add connection string in App.config to database with same name as DB Context class
	be sure to add attribute providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" to Connection String 
6. Enable Code First Migrations - this is done only ONCE for the lifetime of the project
	via Package Manager Console 'enable-migrations'

Steps above are done only once to get project started

After this

You can make changes to model/database going directly to the code

Every time you make changes to model/database code you hvae to generate a migration
	 using add-migration NAME_OF_CHANGE

7. Generate migration file via package manager console
	add-migration CreatePost

8. Next you need to run the migration to have database either upgrade or downgrade accordingly
	PMC: update-database
