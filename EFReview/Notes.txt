Code First with Existing Database
===================================

Process

Reverse Engineer - Existing DB -> Model
Use code first for any subsequent changes

Change model then use migrations to bring DB up to date

Benefits
- Full versioning of the database
- Less time wated in designers; just write code

1. Add ADO.NET Entity Data Model - named MyDBContext


Always work on small changes and small migrations

Big migrations may have errors...

Think like git commit
