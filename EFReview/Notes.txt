Deployment
You’re ready to deploy the application. Your DBA expects you to provide a
database script. Run the following command to get a SQL script of all your
migrations:

Update-Database	-Script	-SourceMigration:0	

This command generates the SQL script from the very first migration to the last
one. In a real-world scenario, you may want to change the range of migrations
included in the SQL script in each deployment. To do this, you can use:

Update-Database	-Script	-SourceMigration:Migr1	-TargetMigration:Migr2
