What is LINQ?
	Language INtegrated Query
	used to bridge the gap between objects and data

LINQ
	can query
		Objects in Memory - find, sort, etc
		XML
		Relational DBs (SQL)
		NoSQL DBs (Mongo)
	same programming model for all

Before LINQ
	needed T-SQL or PL/SQL or XQuery

After LINQ
	use same model for all data stores
	query automatically translated for that data store

Benefits
	No more SQL queries / sprocs (you may still need to write some though)
	Increased productivity

LINQ is for simple queries

If you need more than or complex query write a stored procedure

Everything has its place

There are some instance when you want to use LINQ
and
Then some instances when you want to use T-SQL Stored Procedures
