Repository Pattern
=================================

Repository
	Mediates between the domain and data
	mapping layers, acting like an **in-memory
	collection** of domain objects.
		PoEAA by Martin Fowler
			Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

Benefits
	- Minimizes duplicate query logic
		need to get top 5 courses w/o course
			duplicate query logic all over the place
				can encapsulate into repository
	- Decouples your application from persistence frameworks
		if you switch, do so with minimal impact
	On average, we get a new O/RM every 2 years
		- ADO.NET
		- LINQ to SQL
		- EF v1
		- nHibernate
		- EF v4
		- EF v4: DbContext
		- EF Core
		- Dapper
		- ORMList
		- PetaPocos
	- Want freedom to explore other options
	- Promotes testability
		partially true
		new dbcontext have interface that can mock to unit test application

In a Nutshell

Add(obj)
Remove(obj)
Get(id)
GetAll()
Find(predicate)

- no method called update is found.. why?

- because we want this to act like an **in-memory** collection of objects
	there is no List.update() or array.update()
	you just List.Add(obj)

	var course = collection.Get(1);
	course.Name = "New Name";

	// NO collection.Update(course);

- no db semantics, just a collection no update or save

How are we going to save these objects to the database?????

Unit of Work Pattern
	Maintains a list of objects affected by a
	business transaction and coordinates the
	writing out of changes.
		POEAA by Martin Fowler

Enity Framework
	some say Repository and Unit of Work is already in EF

	<<repository>>			<< unit of work >>
		DbSet					DbContext
	Add(obj)				DbSet
	Remove(obj)				DbSet
	Find(id)				DbSet
	Where(predicate)		SaveChanges()

on surface, yes EF, DBset, DbContext looks like Repository and UofW

Repository
	- minizes duplicate query logic
		DbSet return IQueryables that have to be duplicated
		DbContext is everywhere and fat LINQ queries repeated all over the place
		could use extension methods - but existing linq methods still return iQueryable
		and could write new queries

		repo.GetTopSellingCourses() - encapsulated in repo
			implementation detail
	- decouples app from persistence framework
		if use dbset and dbcontext we are TIGHTLY coupled to EF.. period

	but if app code calls methods from Repository and EF details are hidden away
	in the future we could set Repository to use any other ORM without changing
	app code at all
