Database First vs Code First

Based on preference

Common Misconceptions

X - Database First gives you more control over database
	not true - you can do the same in Code First

X - Code First is for green field projects
	not true - you can reverse engineer current db to make code first

Code First Advantages
- Full versioning of database
	can bring to any version with 1 command
	w/o code first you have to do your own DB versioning
- Productivity
	much faster to write code, then using table designers
	there is learn curve up front

Now where you work there may be a legacy Database and you have to
use Database first, because you need to script changes and go through
change process.
