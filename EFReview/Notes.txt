===================================
Code First with Existing Database
===================================

Process

Reverse Engineer - Existing DB -> Model
Use code first for any subsequent changes

Change model then use migrations to bring DB up to date

Benefits
- Full versioning of the database
- Less time wated in designers; just write code

1. Add ADO.NET Entity Data Model - named MyDBContext


Always work on small changes and small migrations

Big migrations may have errors...

Think like git commit

Modifying an existing column (renaming) is a dangerous
migration b/c EF will create new column and drop the old column
w/o copying the data so you have to make sure to copy data yourself
either with SQL command or change to RenameColumn function
